Project: Part of Speech Tagging with Hidden Markov Models


Introduction

Part of speech tagging is the process of determining the syntactic category of a word from the words in its surrounding context. It is often used to help disambiguate natural language phrases because it can be done quickly with high accuracy. Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis (for example, dis-count as a noun vs dis-count as a verb), for information retrieval, and for word sense disambiguation.

In this notebook, you'll use the Pomegranate library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging using a "universal" tagset. Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.



The notebook already contains some code to get you started. You only need to add some new functionality in the areas indicated to complete the project; you will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with 'IMPLEMENTATION' in the header indicate that you must provide code in the block that follows. Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

**Note:** Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the iPython Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You must then **export the notebook** by running the last cell in the notebook, or by using the menu above and navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)** Your submissions should include both the `html` and `ipynb` files.
**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the `Shift + Enter` keyboard shortcut. Markdown cells can be edited by double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.
The Road Ahead
You must complete Steps 1-3 below to pass the project. The section on Step 4 includes references & resources you can use to further explore HMM taggers.

Step 1: Review the provided interface to load and access the text corpus
Step 2: Build a Most Frequent Class tagger to use as a baseline
Step 3: Build an HMM Part of Speech tagger and compare to the MFC baseline
Step 4: (Optional) Improve the HMM tagger
**Note:** Make sure you have selected a **Python 3** kernel in Workspaces or the hmm-tagger conda environment if you are running the Jupyter server on your own machine.

Step 1: Read and preprocess the dataset
We'll start by reading in a text corpus and splitting it into a training and testing dataset. The data set is a copy of the Brown corpus (originally from the NLTK library) that has already been pre-processed to only include the universal tagset. You should expect to get slightly higher accuracy using this simplified tagset than the same model would achieve on a larger tagset like the full Penn treebank tagset, but the process you'll follow would be the same.

The Dataset class provided in helpers.py will read and parse the corpus. You can generate your own datasets compatible with the reader by writing them to the following format. The dataset is stored in plaintext as a collection of words and corresponding tags. Each sentence starts with a unique identifier on the first line, followed by one tab-separated word/tag pair on each following line. Sentences are separated by a single blank line.

Example from the Brown corpus.

b100-38532
Perhaps	ADV
it	PRON
was	VERB
right	ADJ
;	.
;	.

b100-35577
...
data = Dataset("tags-universal.txt", "brown-universal.txt", train_test_split=0.8)

print("There are {} sentences in the corpus.".format(len(data)))
print("There are {} sentences in the training set.".format(len(data.training_set)))
print("There are {} sentences in the testing set.".format(len(data.testing_set)))

assert len(data) == len(data.training_set) + len(data.testing_set), \
       "The number of sentences in the training set + testing set should sum to the number of sentences in the corpus"
There are 57340 sentences in the corpus.
There are 45872 sentences in the training set.
There are 11468 sentences in the testing set.
The Dataset Interface
You can access (mostly) immutable references to the dataset through a simple interface provided through the Dataset class, which represents an iterable collection of sentences along with easy access to partitions of the data for training & testing. Review the reference below, then run and review the next few cells to make sure you understand the interface before moving on to the next step.

Dataset-only Attributes:
    training_set - reference to a Subset object containing the samples for training
    testing_set - reference to a Subset object containing the samples for testing

Dataset & Subset Attributes:
    sentences - a dictionary with an entry {sentence_key: Sentence()} for each sentence in the corpus
    keys - an immutable ordered (not sorted) collection of the sentence_keys for the corpus
    vocab - an immutable collection of the unique words in the corpus
    tagset - an immutable collection of the unique tags in the corpus
    X - returns an array of words grouped by sentences ((w11, w12, w13, ...), (w21, w22, w23, ...), ...)
    Y - returns an array of tags grouped by sentences ((t11, t12, t13, ...), (t21, t22, t23, ...), ...)
    N - returns the number of distinct samples (individual words or tags) in the dataset

Methods:
    stream() - returns an flat iterable over all (word, tag) pairs across all sentences in the corpus
    __iter__() - returns an iterable over the data as (sentence_key, Sentence()) pairs
    __len__() - returns the nubmer of sentences in the dataset
For example, consider a Subset, subset, of the sentences {"s0": Sentence(("See", "Spot", "run"), ("VERB", "NOUN", "VERB")), "s1": Sentence(("Spot", "ran"), ("NOUN", "VERB"))}. The subset will have these attributes:

subset.keys == {"s1", "s0"}  # unordered
subset.vocab == {"See", "run", "ran", "Spot"}  # unordered
subset.tagset == {"VERB", "NOUN"}  # unordered
subset.X == (("Spot", "ran"), ("See", "Spot", "run"))  # order matches .keys
subset.Y == (("NOUN", "VERB"), ("VERB", "NOUN", "VERB"))  # order matches .keys
subset.N == 7  # there are a total of seven observations over all sentences
len(subset) == 2  # because there are two sentences
**Note:** The `Dataset` class is _convenient_, but it is **not** efficient. It is not suitable for huge datasets because it stores multiple redundant copies of the same data.
Sentences
Dataset.sentences is a dictionary of all sentences in the training corpus, each keyed to a unique sentence identifier. Each Sentence is itself an object with two attributes: a tuple of the words in the sentence named words and a tuple of the tag corresponding to each word named tags.

key = 'b100-38532'
print("Sentence: {}".format(key))
print("words:\n\t{!s}".format(data.sentences[key].words))
print("tags:\n\t{!s}".format(data.sentences[key].tags))
Sentence: b100-38532
words:
	('Perhaps', 'it', 'was', 'right', ';', ';')
tags:
	('ADV', 'PRON', 'VERB', 'ADJ', '.', '.')
data.keys[:2]
('b100-5507', 'b100-935')
**Note:** The underlying iterable sequence is **unordered** over the sentences in the corpus; it is not guaranteed to return the sentences in a consistent order between calls. Use `Dataset.stream()`, `Dataset.keys`, `Dataset.X`, or `Dataset.Y` attributes if you need ordered access to the data.
Counting Unique Elements
You can access the list of unique words (the dataset vocabulary) via Dataset.vocab and the unique list of tags via Dataset.tagset.

print("There are a total of {} samples of {} unique words in the corpus."
      .format(data.N, len(data.vocab)))
print("There are {} samples of {} unique words in the training set."
      .format(data.training_set.N, len(data.training_set.vocab)))
print("There are {} samples of {} unique words in the testing set."
      .format(data.testing_set.N, len(data.testing_set.vocab)))
print("There are {} words in the test set that are missing in the training set."
      .format(len(data.testing_set.vocab - data.training_set.vocab)))

assert data.N == data.training_set.N + data.testing_set.N, \
       "The number of training + test samples should sum to the total number of samples"
There are a total of 1161192 samples of 56057 unique words in the corpus.
There are 928458 samples of 50536 unique words in the training set.
There are 232734 samples of 25112 unique words in the testing set.
There are 5521 words in the test set that are missing in the training set.
Accessing word and tag Sequences
The Dataset.X and Dataset.Y attributes provide access to ordered collections of matching word and tag sequences for each sentence in the dataset.

# accessing words with Dataset.X and tags with Dataset.Y 
for i in range(2):    
    print("Sentence {}:".format(i + 1), data.X[i])
    print()
    print("Labels {}:".format(i + 1), data.Y[i])
    print()
Sentence 1: ('Mr.', 'Podger', 'had', 'thanked', 'him', 'gravely', ',', 'and', 'now', 'he', 'made', 'use', 'of', 'the', 'advice', '.')

Labels 1: ('NOUN', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', 'PRON', 'ADV', '.', 'CONJ', 'ADV', 'PRON', 'VERB', 'NOUN', 'ADP', 'DET', 'NOUN', '.')

Sentence 2: ('But', 'there', 'seemed', 'to', 'be', 'some', 'difference', 'of', 'opinion', 'as', 'to', 'how', 'far', 'the', 'board', 'should', 'go', ',', 'and', 'whose', 'advice', 'it', 'should', 'follow', '.')

Labels 2: ('CONJ', 'PRT', 'VERB', 'PRT', 'VERB', 'DET', 'NOUN', 'ADP', 'NOUN', 'ADP', 'ADP', 'ADV', 'ADV', 'DET', 'NOUN', 'VERB', 'VERB', '.', 'CONJ', 'DET', 'NOUN', 'PRON', 'VERB', 'VERB', '.')
Accessing (word, tag) Samples
The Dataset.stream() method returns an iterator that chains together every pair of (word, tag) entries across all sentences in the entire corpus.

# use Dataset.stream() (word, tag) samples for the entire corpus
sqA = []
dct = defaultdict(list)
count = Counter()
print("\nStream (word, tag) pairs:\n")
for i, pair in enumerate(data.stream()):
    print("\t", pair)
    dct[pair].append(i)
    sqA.append(pair[0].lower())
    if i > 10: break
Stream (word, tag) pairs:

	 ('Mr.', 'NOUN')
	 ('Podger', 'NOUN')
	 ('had', 'VERB')
	 ('thanked', 'VERB')
	 ('him', 'PRON')
	 ('gravely', 'ADV')
	 (',', '.')
	 ('and', 'CONJ')
	 ('now', 'ADV')
	 ('he', 'PRON')
	 ('made', 'VERB')
	 ('use', 'NOUN')
dictTrain =  defaultdict(list)
for i, trainPair in enumerate(data.training_set.stream()):
    #print("\t", trainPair)
    dictTrain[trainPair].append(i)
For both our baseline tagger and the HMM model we'll build, we need to estimate the frequency of tags & words from the frequency counts of observations in the training corpus. In the next several cells you will complete functions to compute the counts of several sets of counts.

Step 2: Build a Most Frequent Class tagger
Perhaps the simplest tagger (and a good baseline for tagger performance) is to simply choose the tag most frequently assigned to each word. This "most frequent class" tagger inspects each observed word in the sequence and assigns it the label that was most often assigned to that word in the corpus.

IMPLEMENTATION: Pair Counts
Complete the function below that computes the joint frequency counts for two input sequences.

tags = (tag for i, (word, tag) in enumerate(data.training_set.stream()))
words = (word for i, (word, tag) in enumerate(data.training_set.stream()))
dict_tag_word = defaultdict(list)
dict_word = defaultdict(list)
def pair_counts(sequences_A=None, sequences_B=None):
    """Return a dictionary keyed to each unique value in the first sequence list
    that counts the number of occurrences of the corresponding value from the
    second sequences list.
    
    For example, if sequences_A is tags and sequences_B is the corresponding
    words, then if 1244 sequences contain the word "time" tagged as a NOUN, then
    you should return a dictionary such that pair_counts[NOUN][time] == 1244
    """
    # TODO: Finish this function!
    for i, (tag,word) in enumerate(zip(sequences_A,sequences_B)):
        dict_tag_word[tag].append(word)
    for k in dict_tag_word.keys():
        dict_word[k] = Counter(dict_tag_word[k])
    
    return dict_word


# Calculate C(t_i, w_i)
emission_counts = pair_counts(tags, words)

assert len(emission_counts) == 12, \
       "Uh oh. There should be 12 tags in your dictionary."
assert max(emission_counts["NOUN"], key=emission_counts["NOUN"].get) == 'time', \
       "Hmmm...'time' is expected to be the most common NOUN."
HTML('<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">Your emission counts look good!</div>')
Your emission counts look good!
IMPLEMENTATION: Most Frequent Class Tagger
Use the pair_counts() function and the training dataset to find the most frequent class label for each word in the training data, and populate the mfc_table below. The table keys should be words, and the values should be the appropriate tag string.

The MFCTagger class is provided to mock the interface of Pomegranite HMM models so that they can be used interchangeably.

Making Predictions with a Model
The helper functions provided below interface with Pomegranate network models & the mocked MFCTagger to take advantage of the missing value functionality in Pomegranate through a simple sequence decoding function. Run these functions, then run the next cell to see some of the predictions made by the MFC tagger.

def replace_unknown(sequence):
    """Return a copy of the input sequence where each unknown word is replaced
    by the literal string value 'nan'. Pomegranate will ignore these values
    during computation.
    """

testing accuracy mfc_model: 93.00%
Your MFC tagger accuracy looks correct!
Step 3: Build an HMM tagger
The HMM tagger has one hidden state for each possible tag, and parameterized by two distributions: the emission probabilties giving the conditional probability of observing a given word from each hidden state, and the transition probabilities giving the conditional probability of moving between tags during the sequence.

We will also estimate the starting probability distribution (the probability of each tag being the first tag in a sequence), and the terminal probability distribution (the probability of each tag being the last tag in a sequence).

The maximum likelihood estimate of these distributions can be calculated from the frequency counts as described in the following sections where you'll implement functions to count the frequencies, and finally build the model. The HMM model will make predictions according to the formula:

$$t_i^n = \underset{t_i^n}{\mathrm{argmin}} \prod_{i=1}^n P(w_i|t_i) P(t_i|t_{i-1})$$

Refer to Speech & Language Processing Chapter 10 for more information.

IMPLEMENTATION: Unigram Counts
Complete the function below to estimate the co-occurrence frequency of each symbol over all of the input sequences. The unigram probabilities in our HMM model are estimated from the formula below, where N is the total number of samples in the input. (You only need to compute the counts for now.)

IMPLEMENTATION: Basic HMM Tagger
Use the tag unigrams and bigrams calculated above to construct a hidden Markov tagger.

Add one state per tag
The emission distribution at each state should be estimated with the formula: $P(w|t) = \frac{C(t, w)}{C(t)}$
Add an edge from the starting state basic_model.start to each tag
The transition probability should be estimated with the formula: $P(t|start) = \frac{C(start, t)}{C(start)}$
Add an edge from each tag to the end state basic_model.end
The transition probability should be estimated with the formula: $P(end|t) = \frac{C(t, end)}{C(t)}$
Add an edge between every pair of tags
The transition probability should be estimated with the formula: $P(t_2|t_1) = \frac{C(t_1, t_2)}{C(t_1)}$

Step 4: [Optional] Improving model performance
There are additional enhancements that can be incorporated into your tagger that improve performance on larger tagsets where the data sparsity problem is more significant. The data sparsity problem arises because the same amount of data split over more tags means there will be fewer samples in each tag, and there will be more missing data tags that have zero occurrences in the data. The techniques in this section are optional.

Laplace Smoothing (pseudocounts) Laplace smoothing is a technique where you add a small, non-zero value to all observed counts to offset for unobserved values.

Backoff Smoothing Another smoothing technique is to interpolate between n-grams for missing data. This method is more effective than Laplace smoothing at combatting the data sparsity problem. Refer to chapters 4, 9, and 10 of the Speech & Language Processing book for more information.

Extending to Trigrams HMM taggers have achieved better than 96% accuracy on this dataset with the full Penn treebank tagset using an architecture described in this paper. Altering your HMM to achieve the same performance would require implementing deleted interpolation (described in the paper), incorporating trigram probabilities in your frequency tables, and re-implementing the Viterbi algorithm to consider three consecutive states instead of two.

Obtain the Brown Corpus with a Larger Tagset
Run the code below to download a copy of the brown corpus with the full NLTK tagset. You will need to research the available tagset information in the NLTK docs and determine the best way to extract the subset of NLTK tags you want to explore. If you write the following the format specified in Step 1, then you can reload the data using all of the code above for comparison.

Refer to Chapter 5 of the NLTK book for more information on the available tagsets.
